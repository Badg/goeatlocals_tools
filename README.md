# Quick disclaimer

If you're reading this, you happened to stumble upon (or, hopefully, were linked to)
a repository in an **extremely** work-in-progress state, something that I never really
intended to upload publicly. It's part exploration, part prototyping, part creation for
creation's sake. In other words, it's a personal project! That context colors pretty much
every decision made here.

Please note: unless explicitly commented otherwise, I wrote all of this code, it
has no license, and all rights are reserved. It is probably
broken, it is littered with to-do's, and it was never intended to see the light of
day in this state.

Inside ``.taetime`` you'll find some infra-as-code terraform files. Unfortunately,
these won't be able to run outside of my development environment, as they use some
non-public scripts to wrap boilerplate.
